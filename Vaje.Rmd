## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
x<- 1:10
y <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)
pl <- plot(x = x, y = y)
lat <- lattice::dotplot(x ~ y)
lat
ggplot2::qplot(x = x, y = y)
```
```{r }
plot(x)
```

```{r  eval=FALSE}
plot(x)
```

```{r echo=FALSE }
plot(x)
```
